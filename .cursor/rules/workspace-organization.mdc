# Workspace Organization

Follow this structure for organizing project files and documentation.

## Project Structure

Organize projects with clear separation of concerns:

```
.
├── SUMMARY.md              # Project overview, objectives, problem statement, solution
├── README.md               # Usage instructions, setup, examples
├── api-key/                # API credentials (if needed)
│   └── *.json
├── reference/               # Reference data extracted from APIs/CLI
│   └── *.json, *.csv
├── reports/                 # Source reports and data files (PDFs, JSON, etc.)
│   └── *.pdf, *.json, etc.
├── scripts/                 # Executable scripts and tools
│   └── *.py, *.sh, etc.
└── results/                 # Generated outputs and processed data
    └── *.md, *.json, *.csv, etc.
```

## Documentation Files

### SUMMARY.md

Create a `SUMMARY.md` file at the project root that explains:
- What we're trying to accomplish (objective)
- Why we're doing it (problem statement)
- How we're solving it (solution approach)
- What the output should be (requirements)

Keep it concise and focused on the "what" and "why" rather than implementation details.

### README.md

Create a `README.md` file that provides:
- Quick overview (can reference SUMMARY.md)
- Prerequisites and setup
- Usage instructions with examples
- Project structure diagram
- Links to other relevant documentation

Focus on "how to use" rather than "what we're doing".

## Scripts Organization

- Place all executable scripts in a `scripts/` folder
- Use descriptive script names that indicate their purpose
- Make scripts executable (`chmod +x`)
- Include shebang lines for scripts (`#!/usr/bin/env python3`, `#!/bin/bash`)
- Scripts should handle relative paths correctly (resolve paths relative to script location when needed)

## Reports Organization

- Place source reports and data files in a `reports/` folder
- Use descriptive, lowercase filenames with hyphens: `aws-cis-4.0.1.pdf`
- Organize by source or type if needed: `reports/aws/`, `reports/azure/`
- Keep original downloaded files here before processing

## Results Organization

- Place generated outputs and processed data in a `results/` folder
- Use descriptive filenames that indicate source and content: `aws-cis-4.0.1-policies.md`
- Keep processed/extracted data separate from source reports
- Results are generated artifacts, reports are source materials

## File Naming

- Use lowercase with hyphens for file names: `extract-policy-inventory.py`
- Use descriptive names that indicate purpose
- Avoid generic names like `script.py` or `tool.sh`

## When Creating New Projects

1. Create `SUMMARY.md` first to document objectives
2. Create `README.md` with usage instructions
3. Create folder structure:
   - `scripts/` folder for executable tools
   - `reports/` folder for source data/reports
   - `results/` folder for generated outputs
4. Place files in appropriate folders, not project root
5. Update README with project structure section

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Placing scripts, reports, or results in project root
- Mixing source files with generated outputs
- Mixing documentation and code in same directory
- Creating scripts without clear purpose or documentation
- Using vague file names
- Missing project overview (SUMMARY.md)
- Storing source reports and processed results in the same location
