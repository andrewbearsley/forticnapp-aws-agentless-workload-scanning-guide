# Writing Style: Remove AI Patterns

When writing any text, identify and remove signs of AI-generated writing to make it sound natural and human. This guide is based on Wikipedia's "Signs of AI writing" page, maintained by WikiProject AI Cleanup.

## Core Principles

1. **Identify AI patterns** - Scan for the patterns listed below
2. **Rewrite problematic sections** - Replace AI-isms with natural alternatives
3. **Preserve meaning** - Keep the core message intact
4. **Maintain voice** - Match the intended tone (formal, casual, technical, etc.)
5. **Add soul** - Don't just remove bad patterns; inject actual personality

## Personality and Soul

Avoiding AI patterns is only half the job. Sterile, voiceless writing is just as obvious as slop. Good writing has a human behind it.

### Signs of soulless writing (even if technically "clean"):
- Every sentence is the same length and structure
- No opinions, just neutral reporting
- No acknowledgment of uncertainty or mixed feelings
- No first-person perspective when appropriate
- No humor, no edge, no personality
- Reads like a Wikipedia article or press release

### How to add voice:

**Have opinions.** Don't just report facts - react to them. "I genuinely don't know how to feel about this" is more human than neutrally listing pros and cons.

**Vary your rhythm.** Short punchy sentences. Then longer ones that take their time getting where they're going. Mix it up.

**Acknowledge complexity.** Real humans have mixed feelings. "This is impressive but also kind of unsettling" beats "This is impressive."

**Use "I" when it fits.** First person isn't unprofessional - it's honest. "I keep coming back to..." or "Here's what gets me..." signals a real person thinking.

**Let some mess in.** Perfect structure feels algorithmic. Tangents, asides, and half-formed thoughts are human.

**Be specific about feelings.** Not "this is concerning" but "there's something unsettling about agents churning away at 3am while nobody's watching."

## Content Patterns to Avoid

### 1. Undue Emphasis on Significance, Legacy, and Broader Trends

**Words to watch:** stands/serves as, is a testament/reminder, a vital/significant/crucial/pivotal/key role/moment, underscores/highlights its importance/significance, reflects broader, symbolizing its ongoing/enduring/lasting, contributing to the, setting the stage for, marking/shaping the, represents/marks a shift, key turning point, evolving landscape, focal point, indelible mark, deeply rooted

**Problem:** LLM writing puffs up importance by adding statements about how arbitrary aspects represent or contribute to a broader topic.

**Before:**
> The Statistical Institute of Catalonia was officially established in 1989, marking a pivotal moment in the evolution of regional statistics in Spain.

**After:**
> The Statistical Institute of Catalonia was established in 1989 to collect and publish regional statistics independently from Spain's national statistics office.

### 2. Superficial Analyses with -ing Endings

**Words to watch:** highlighting/underscoring/emphasizing..., ensuring..., reflecting/symbolizing..., contributing to..., cultivating/fostering..., encompassing..., showcasing...

**Problem:** AI chatbots tack present participle ("-ing") phrases onto sentences to add fake depth.

**Before:**
> The temple's color palette resonates with the region's natural beauty, symbolizing Texas bluebonnets, reflecting the community's deep connection to the land.

**After:**
> The temple uses blue, green, and gold colors. The architect said these were chosen to reference local bluebonnets.

### 3. Promotional and Advertisement-like Language

**Words to watch:** boasts a, vibrant, rich (figurative), profound, enhancing its, showcasing, exemplifies, commitment to, natural beauty, nestled, in the heart of, groundbreaking (figurative), renowned, breathtaking, must-visit, stunning

**Problem:** LLMs have serious problems keeping a neutral tone.

**Before:**
> Nestled within the breathtaking region of Gonder in Ethiopia, Alamata Raya Kobo stands as a vibrant town with a rich cultural heritage.

**After:**
> Alamata Raya Kobo is a town in the Gonder region of Ethiopia, known for its weekly market and 18th-century church.

### 4. Vague Attributions and Weasel Words

**Words to watch:** Industry reports, Observers have cited, Experts argue, Some critics argue, several sources/publications (when few cited)

**Problem:** AI chatbots attribute opinions to vague authorities without specific sources.

**Before:**
> Experts believe it plays a crucial role in the regional ecosystem.

**After:**
> According to a 2019 survey by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the river supports several endemic fish species.

### 5. Overused "AI Vocabulary" Words

**High-frequency AI words:** Additionally, align with, crucial, delve, emphasizing, enduring, enhance, fostering, garner, highlight (verb), interplay, intricate/intricacies, key (adjective), landscape (abstract noun), pivotal, showcase, tapestry (abstract noun), testament, underscore (verb), valuable, vibrant

**Problem:** These words appear far more frequently in post-2023 text. They often co-occur.

**Before:**
> Additionally, a distinctive feature is the incorporation of camel meat. An enduring testament to Italian colonial influence is the widespread adoption of pasta, showcasing how these dishes have integrated into the traditional diet.

**After:**
> Somali cuisine also includes camel meat, which is considered a delicacy. Pasta dishes, introduced during Italian colonization, remain common, especially in the south.

### 6. Avoidance of "is"/"are" (Copula Avoidance)

**Words to watch:** serves as/stands as/marks/represents [a], boasts/features/offers [a]

**Problem:** LLMs substitute elaborate constructions for simple copulas.

**Before:**
> Gallery 825 serves as LAAA's exhibition space. The gallery features four separate spaces and boasts over 3,000 square feet.

**After:**
> Gallery 825 is LAAA's exhibition space. The gallery has four rooms totaling 3,000 square feet.

### 7. Negative Parallelisms

**Problem:** Constructions like "Not only...but..." or "It's not just about..., it's..." are overused.

**Before:**
> It's not just about the beat riding under the vocals; it's part of the aggression and atmosphere.

**After:**
> The heavy beat adds to the aggressive tone.

### 8. Rule of Three Overuse

**Problem:** LLMs force ideas into groups of three to appear comprehensive.

**Before:**
> The event features keynote sessions, panel discussions, and networking opportunities. Attendees can expect innovation, inspiration, and industry insights.

**After:**
> The event includes talks and panels. There's also time for informal networking between sessions.

### 9. Em Dash Overuse

**Problem:** LLMs use em dashes (—) more than humans, mimicking "punchy" sales writing.

**Before:**
> The term is primarily promoted by Dutch institutions—not by the people themselves. You don't say "Netherlands, Europe" as an address—yet this mislabeling continues—even in official documents.

**After:**
> The term is primarily promoted by Dutch institutions, not by the people themselves. You don't say "Netherlands, Europe" as an address, yet this mislabeling continues in official documents.

### 10. Filler Phrases

**Before → After:**
- "In order to achieve this goal" → "To achieve this"
- "Due to the fact that it was raining" → "Because it was raining"
- "At this point in time" → "Now"
- "In the event that you need help" → "If you need help"
- "The system has the ability to process" → "The system can process"
- "It is important to note that the data shows" → "The data shows"

### 11. Excessive Hedging

**Problem:** Over-qualifying statements.

**Before:**
> It could potentially possibly be argued that the policy might have some effect on outcomes.

**After:**
> The policy may affect outcomes.

### 12. Generic Positive Conclusions

**Problem:** Vague upbeat endings.

**Before:**
> The future looks bright for the company. Exciting times lie ahead as they continue their journey toward excellence.

**After:**
> The company plans to open two more locations next year.

## Process

When writing or editing text:

1. Read the text carefully
2. Identify all instances of the patterns above
3. Rewrite each problematic section
4. Ensure the revised text:
   - Sounds natural when read aloud
   - Varies sentence structure naturally
   - Uses specific details over vague claims
   - Maintains appropriate tone for context
   - Uses simple constructions (is/are/has) where appropriate

## Reference

This rule is based on [Wikipedia:Signs of AI writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing), maintained by WikiProject AI Cleanup. The patterns documented there come from observations of thousands of instances of AI-generated text on Wikipedia.

Key insight: "LLMs use statistical algorithms to guess what should come next. The result tends toward the most statistically likely result that applies to the widest variety of cases."
